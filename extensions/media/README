This extension serves related media files from the views directory, allowing
you to keep javascript and CSS files near the templates during development.

The file
  ./views/something/whatever.css
will be served as
  /media/views/something/whatever.css

The file can end in .tpl
  ./views/something/whatever.css.tpl
in which case it will be considered a regular view template such that
smarty code will be evaluated in it.  Since javascript and CSS use the default
smarty delimiters of { and }, in a .js.tpl or .css.tpl file the smarty 
delimiters are {{ and }}.  So
  {$smarty.server.SERVER_SOFTWARE}
  {foreach from=$x item=y}
becomes
  {{$smarty.server.SERVER_SOFTWARE}}
  {{foreach from=$x item=y}}

It is not recommended to make heavy use of this.
