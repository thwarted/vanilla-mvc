The files in this directory are executed at the following times:

global_conf.php (required)
    The first thing that is executed.  Should be used to setup
    the PHP environment, such as changing the error_reporting()
    level, if necessary.
    There are also some settings in here that should be modified 
    on a per-site basis.


*.setup.php (optional)
    Executed in sorted order.  Should be used to open database
    connections, start sessions, etc.


smarty_custom.php (required, but may be an empty class)
    Defines a single class whose methods will be used to extend
    smarty through additional modifiers, functions, etc.


template_conf.php (optional)
    If this file exists, it will be included at every point
    when a new smarty object is instanciated.  Any customizations
    to the smarty object should happen here.
